# AI Notebook Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing and updating notebooks for my commonly used large models, including BLIP2 and MusicGen.


## Projects

### BLIP2

BLIP2 is a model focused on image and text interaction, capable of tasks such as image captioning and text-to-image search. The `blip2.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the use of the BLIP2 model for processing images and texts.

### MusicGen

MusicGen is a project aimed at generating music using AI. The `musicgen.ipynb` notebook contains examples of how to generate music clips, with outputs stored in the `audio_output` directory.

## Usage

To get started with these projects, navigate to their respective directories and follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks.
